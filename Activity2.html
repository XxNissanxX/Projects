<body>
    Pizza is an Italian dish of a flattened dough base topped with sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients, baked at a
    high temperature. Originating in Naples, the modern pizza emerged in the 18th century as a food for the working class,
    but it gained global popularity after Italian immigrants brought it to the United States. A famous variety, the
    Margherita pizza, features tomato, mozzarella, and basil and is said to have been named after Queen Margherita of Savoy.
